description: "Generates and verifies a complete design documentation set for a software project: premise audit, decision register, planning and design documents, the fourteen document classes, traceability, and mechanical verification with three gating scripts. Use when the user says 'documenta este proyecto', 'genera la documentación de diseño', 'completar la documentación', 'documentación en regla', 'plan de proyecto completo', 'design docs for this project', 'requirements with stable IDs', 'traceability matrix', 'NFR with measurable targets', or when a project idea needs to become a verified design document set before any code is written. Also use to audit an existing document set for gaps."

# Docs Pipeline

Turns a project idea into a **complete, verified design documentation set** — and then checks it mechanically, because instructions are advisory and exit codes are not.

**The output is a document set that can be handed to an implementer or an AI agent with no further architectural decisions to make.**

---

## When to use this

| Situation | Enter at |
| :--- | :--- |
| A raw idea document exists and needs to become a design | Phase 0 |
| A document set exists and may be incomplete | Phase 5, then 7 |
| A document set exists and needs verification only | Phase 7 |
| The user asks "what else is missing?" | Phase 5 |

---

## The four ideas this pipeline is built on

1. **Audit the premises before generating anything.** An idea document assumes things it never states — that there is a client, a team, a budget, a deployment. If those premises are wrong, generating fourteen documents produces fourteen wrong documents, faster. This is the highest-value step and it must block.
2. **Separate assumptions from decisions, then order by blocking power.** A flat list of 40 questions is unusable. Deduplicated and tiered by what they block, it is 25 answerable questions, most with a defensible default.
3. **Complete is a checklist, not a feeling.** Fourteen document classes. A set can be well written and still missing the spine.
4. **Verify mechanically.** Three scripts, run before every commit. What they catch is what a human stops noticing after the second document.

---

## Phase 0 — Intake

Read the input. Identify, in one pass:

- **Domain** and what the system does
- **Actors** and which of them touch the system
- **Scale claims** (how many users, orders, branches)
- **The stack the idea proposes**, if any
- **What the document assumes but never states**

Write nothing yet.

## Phase 1 — Premise audit · BLOCKING

Read [`references/premise-audit.md`](references/premise-audit.md) and apply it.

The three premises that change everything:

| Premise | If false, what changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Who builds it** — a team, or one person | Scope, timeline, and whether the MVP is feasible at all |
| **Who it is for** — a client with requirements, or the author's portfolio | Every "requirement" is a design decision, not a client demand |
| **Where it runs** — on-premise, cloud, one host | The entire deployment and infrastructure section |

**Gate:** present the corrected framing and the questions it raises. **Do not generate a single document until the user confirms it.**

> Skipping this gate is the single most expensive mistake this pipeline can make. It happened: 38 documents were generated for a project that assumed a client, a three-developer team and an on-premise deployment. None of the three existed. Fifteen documents had to be archived.

---

## Phase 2 — Decision register · BLOCKING

Read [`references/decision-register.md`](references/decision-register.md).

1. **Collect** every assumption from the input plus every decision the design will require.
2. **Deduplicate.** Assumptions and decisions overlap heavily: "the stack is Next.js" is both. A 39-item list became 29 questions.
3. **Tier by blocking power**, not by topic. Tier 0 blocks everything; Tier 5 blocks nothing.
4. **Recommend** a value for every question, with the reason. Most questions should be answerable by approving a batch.
5. **Ask tier by tier**, in batches. Present the whole register so the user sees the shape, then ask about the tier that blocks.

**Gate:** the tier-0 questions must be answered before Phase 3. Everything else can be approved in a batch or corrected later.

> **Answer format that works:** a single table of question → recommendation → answer. The user replies "acepto todo salvo P04 y P11". Do not ask one question per turn across 30 turns.

---

## Phase 3 — Planning

Load and follow `planning-core`, `planning-roadmap`, `planning-risk`, `planning-stakeholders`, `planning-status` (or `agent-planning` for the compact form).

Produces: charter, roadmap, risks, stakeholders, status.

**Adapt to the real premise.** A solo portfolio project has no stakeholders and no RACI. A risk register for a team project is not a risk register for a solo one — abandonment and scope creep replace team rotation and client churn.

---

## Phase 4 — Design

Load and follow `design-core`, `design-data`, `design-api`, `design-adr` (or `agent-design`).

Produces: architecture, schema, API contract, ADRs, technical spec.

**Rules that matter:**
- The **OpenAPI contract is the source of truth**. No endpoint is implemented before it is specified.
- Every significant decision gets an ADR with **alternatives considered and rejected**. An ADR without rejected alternatives is a note, not a decision record.
- Money, time and identifiers get explicit rules. `NUMERIC(19,4)`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, UUIDv7.

---

## Phase 5 — Completeness layer

Read [`references/completeness.md`](references/completeness.md).

**This is the phase most often skipped, and it is where a design becomes verifiable.** Compare the set against the fourteen document classes and generate what is missing.

The four that are almost always missing, and why they matter:

| Missing class | What breaks without it |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Requirements with stable IDs** | Nothing else can reference anything. This is the spine |
| **Non-functional requirements with numbers** | A target that cannot be measured is a wish. "Fast" is not a requirement |
| **Traceability matrix** | Nothing proves the design is complete, or that no endpoint is scope creep |
| **Operations runbook** | No backup procedure, no incident response, no capacity model. An unrehearsed restore is not a backup |

---

## Phase 6 — Design system

Load and follow `agent-anti-slop-designer-experimental` (risky, memorable) or `agent-anti-slop-designer` (safer).

**Derive the visual direction from the domain, not from a menu of art movements.** The best design system is made of the product's own artifacts. A restaurant system is made of thermal tickets, rubber stamps and heat lamps; a logistics system is made of manifests, barcodes and loading docks.

Then update `agent-docs/DESIGN.md` to a token sheet pointing at the full document. **A stale token sheet is worse than none**, because an agent will read it.

---

## Phase 7 — Verification · BLOCKING

Run all three scripts. Fix what fails, or declare it explicitly in the document.

```bash
python scripts/check-docs.py          <project-dir>
python scripts/check-traceability.py  <project-dir>
python scripts/check-consistency.py   <project-dir>
```

### Severity model

Not every check should gate. A check that fails on false positives gets ignored, which is worse than no check.

| Check | Severity | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Missing required document class | **GATE** | The set is incomplete by definition |
| Broken internal link | **GATE** | A navigational link that goes nowhere is a defect |
| Emoji in an English document | **GATE** | A stated convention |
| Mermaid in `agent-docs/` | **GATE** | Agent docs use text graphs |
| Requirement ID traced but undefined | **GATE** | A reference to something that does not exist |
| Requirement defined but untraced | **GATE** | The design does not cover it |
| Endpoint in the contract, untraced | **GATE** | Either scope creep or a missing requirement |
| NFR group untraced | **GATE** | No verification method |
| ADR referenced but absent | **GATE** | A dangling decision reference |
| Count conflicts | *Advisory* (`--strict` to gate) | Ambiguous nouns: "33 tables" and "24 tables" are not a contradiction when one means schema and the other means seed data |
| Endpoints traced but outside the contract | *Advisory* | Expected when the contract covers an earlier release than the matrix |
| Paths in prose not found | *Advisory* | Planned artifacts and conventions are legitimately not files yet |
| Duplicated table headers | *Advisory* | A summary in two documents is fine; it drifts when values change |

### Known false-positive classes

Documented so they are not "fixed" by weakening a real check:

| Symptom | Real cause | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NFR-1` reported as an undefined ID | The pattern reads `NFR-1.1` as `NFR-1` | Negative lookahead for `.digit`, plus an ignore-prefix list |
| Business rules (`RN-01`) reported as untraced requirements | A different ID namespace | Add the prefix to the ignore list |
| `/orders/{id}` vs `/orders/{orderId}` reported as different endpoints | Path parameter names are an implementation detail | Normalise `{...}` to `{}` on both sides |
| Narrative documents reported as contradicting themselves | A decision log and a changelog describe past states on purpose | Exclude them: they are records, not live documents |
| The raw idea document reported as full of undefined IDs | It is the input, not part of the set | Exclude `index.md` |
| Archived documents reported with broken links | Archive is a record; a link to something that moved is expected | Exclude `archive/` from every check |

---

## Phase 8 — Publish

Read [`references/publish.md`](references/publish.md).

Git hygiene that prevents problems later: `eol=lf` in `.gitattributes`, a minimal `.gitignore`, `main` as the branch, conventional commits.

**Archive, never delete.** A superseded document moves to `docs/archive/`. The question "why did this change?" has an answer six months later.

---

## Language split

Read [`references/language-split.md`](references/language-split.md).

Documents are written for a reader, and different readers need different languages. The portfolio surface goes in English; the working documents stay in the author's language. Translating a working document is effort with no benefit.

---

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not estimate in points or hours.** That is a separate concern. Effort ranges in weeks are fine; a Fibonacci estimate is not this skill's job.
- **Does not write code.** It produces the design and the scaffold order. The implementation is a separate pass.
- **Does not run the design system questionnaire.** It delegates that to the anti-slop skill.
- **Does not generate a document set before Phase 1 and 2 are confirmed.** This is the one hard rule.
- **Does not weaken a check to make it pass.** If a check fails, either the document is wrong or the check has a documented false-positive class. Fix the right one.
